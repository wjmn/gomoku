# Rules

[Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku), also known as *Five-in-a-Row*, is a simple two-player board game where you aim to place five stones in a row before your opponent. 

The board consists of a grid of intersecting lines. You and your opponent alternate turns placing a stone of your colour anywhere on the board where two lines intersect. The first person to place five stones in a row wins (horizontally, vertically or diagonally). 

*Note*: This is an example game written in Elm as a template for the Heuristic Problem Solving class. This game has been compiled in `dev` mode for the website, so you'll be able to see and use Elm's time-travelling debugger in the bottom right hand corner of the application. See the source code and documentation for this example game on [GitHub](https://github.com/wjmn/gomoku).
